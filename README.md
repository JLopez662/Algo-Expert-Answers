# Solutions for 100+ AlgoExpert Exercises

This repository contains the solutions for more than 100 exercises from AlgoExpert, a platform that provides curated interview prep material for software engineers. Each exercise is a coding question related to algorithms, data structures, or system design.

## Content

The repository consists of 16 folders, one for each type of exercise. The folders are named as follows:

- [`Arrays`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Arrays)
- [`Binary Search Trees`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Binary%20Search%20Trees)
- [`Binary Trees`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Binary%20Trees)
- [`Dynamic Programming`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Dynamic%20Programming)
- [`Famous Algorithms`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Famous%20Algorithms)
- [`Graphs`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Graphs)
- [`Greedy Algorithms`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Greedy%20Algorithms)
- [`Heaps`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Heaps)
- [`Linked Lists`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Linked%20Lists)
- [`Recursion`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Recursion)
- [`Searching`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Searching)
- [`Sorting`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Sorting)
- [`Stacks`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Stacks)
- [`Strings`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Strings)
- [`Tries`](https://github.com/JLopez662/Algo-Expert-Answers/tree/main/Tries)

Each folder contains several C++ files, each corresponding to one exercise. The naming convention for the files is `exercise_N.cpp`,given the name and type of file for the exercise. 


You can use these solutions to check your own answers or as a reference to learn new approaches to solving coding problems. However, keep in mind that simply copying these solutions without understanding them will not help you in the long run.
